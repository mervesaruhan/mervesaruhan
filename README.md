##Hi, I'm Merve Saruhan! 👋
👩🏻‍💻 About Me 👩🏻‍💻

I am a backend developer with a strong foundation in .NET, C#, and Entity Framework Core. Currently, I am improving my skills in Spring Boot to expand my expertise in backend development.

I have worked on various projects such as a site management system and a bookstore e-commerce platform. These projects involved implementing core features like CRUD operations, JWT integration, payment systems, and database migrations to enhance functionality and improve security.

With a bachelor's degree, I bring strong analytical thinking and problem-solving skills to my development process, ensuring well-structured and efficient solutions.

I am passionate about learning new technologies, developing impactful projects, and continuously improving myself.

🚀 Open to new opportunities.
